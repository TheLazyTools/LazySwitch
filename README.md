# LazySwap / LazySwitch

LazySwap was created to replace other worse macros, by using a trash UI we insure your pupils will bleed and retinas will tear, it'll get you into diamond so you don't die to that pesky rogue but it won't stop you quickdropping to that archer around the corner.

**Seriously though we don't have a discord server or telegram so do not download off random kids just use the github link**

**ALSO STAR US SO WE MAKE IT OUT THE HOOD**

## Bugs

- Must hold shift + the switch key to actually use that key will the program is active
- When using fullscreen to avoid error you should hover over the bottom right corners of each slot
- Trash UI (ITS A FEATURE!)
